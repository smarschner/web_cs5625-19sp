<h3>Written Part</h3>
In this problem, we are going to model image sampling and reconstruction. You are welcome to use your favorite language (MATLAB, Python, Julia, etc.) and their built-in functions. Please submit a PDF file that includes your images and code scripts.
<h4>A. Sampling</h4>
<p>1). Load image1.jpg in the repo as the source image.</p>
<p>2). Make a 256x256 image by point-sampling the source image. Observe there is aliasing.</p>
<p>3). Use a Gaussian filter to blur the source image and then point sample. Observe there is less aliasing compared to 2).</p>
4). Construct the impulse grid that corresponds to the point-sampling. Plot the amplitude of the Fourier Transform of the following four images: the source image, the blurred image, and each of these images multiplied by the impulse grid. Observe the copying of spectra and the overlaps for the non-smoothed case.

<h4>B. Reconstruction</h4>
<p>1). Load image2.jpg in the repo as the source image.</p>
<p>2). Make this 256x256 image into a 512x512 one by creating a grid of dots (pixels from the source image).</p>
<p>3). Reconstruct a 512x512 image by convolving with a box filter. Observe this corresponds to replicating pixels.</p>
<p>4). Reconstruct a 512x512 image by convolving with a tent filter. Observe this corresponds to bilinear interpolation.</p>
5). Plot the Fourier Transform of the impulse grid and the reconstructed images. Observe the process of cutting out one copy of the spectrum.
