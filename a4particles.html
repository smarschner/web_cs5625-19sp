<p><strong>Due: ??? (11:59pm).</strong> Work on your own or in groups of 2, as you prefer.</p>

<p>
  In this system you will adapt a simple particle system that uses forward Euler's method as its integrator to use two fancier methods: symplectic Euler (this is a really small change) and Position Based Dynamics (this is more involved).  You may want to start by familiarizing yourself with "Differential Equation Basics" and "Particle Dynamics" in Baraff and Witkin's course notes, and with M&uuml;ller et al. 2006 &ldquo;Position Based Dynamics&rdquo;, both linked from the schedule above.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Both position-based and Newtonian simulations for interactive applications often use particle systems: objects (even things like cloth, ropes, deformable solids, or even fluids) are represented as collections of point masses that interact with one another to produce the behaviors of the overall system.  The position-based approach differs from the traditional Newtonian approach in how it represents these interactions that hold objects together.  In the more familiar Newtonian model used by the starter code, particles exert forces on one another and their motion is entirely described by a second-order differential equation.  In the position-based approach, the particles do not exert forces on one another but instead are affected by soft constraints: functions of the particle positions that are zero in the same configurations where the forces in the Newtonian system would be zero.
</p>
<p>
  To represent the same interactions in the two formulations, we start with constraint functions and take two paths: for the Newtonian system, define an energy and then differentiate the energy to obtian a force; for the position-based system, differentiate the constraint itself and derive a constraint projection equation that can be used to approximately satisfy constraints.
</p>
<p>
  Our simulator actually supports four types of influences on particles, which we generically call "forces" even though they are not always literally implemented with forces:
  <ol>
    <li>Gravity: a unary, constant force \(f = mg\) where \(f\) is the force (of gravity) on a particle, \(m\) is the particle's mass, and \(g\) is the acceleration of gravity.  It is always treated as a force, not a constraint.</li>
    <li>Pin: a unary force that pulls a particle towards a fixed location.  Its constraint equation is \(C(\vp) = \|\vp - \vp_0\|^2\) where \(\vp\) is the position of the particle and \(\vp_0\) is a fixed position.</li>
    <li>Stretching: a binary force that pushes a pair of particles towards a fixed separation distance.  Its constraint equation is \[
      C(\vp_i, \vp_j) = \frac{\|\vp_i - \vp_j\|}{l} - 1,
    \] where \(\vp_i\) and \(\vp_j\) are the positions of the two particles affected by the constraint and \(l\) is th rest length of the spring.</li>
    <li>Bending: a ternary force that pushes three particles towards  collinear configurations.  Its constraint equation is \[
      C(\vp_i, \vp_j, \vp_k) = \frac{\vp_j - \vp_i}{\|\vp_j - \vp_i\|} \cdot \frac{\vp_k - \vp_j}{\|\vp_k - \vp_j\|} - 1.
    \]  The constraint function is based on the cosine of the angle between the two segments \(\vp_i\)&ndash;\(\vp_j\) and \(\vp_j\)&ndash;\(\vp_k\), and is zero when the cosine is 1&mdash;that is, when the two segments are collinear.</li>
  </ol>
  In this assignment we use the symbol \(\vp\), a 3-vector, to denote the 3D position of a point or particle, with a subscript index to distinguish different particles, and \(\vx\) to denote the overall position state of the system, which contains the values of \(\vp_i\) for \(i = 1\ldots n\), all stacked into a single \(3n\)-vector.  The symbol \(\nabla\) is a derivative with respect to \(\vx\), and derivatives with respect to other variables can be written in two ways: \[\nabla_\vp f(\vp, \ldots) = \frac{\partial f(\vp, \ldots)}{\partial \vp}.\]
</p>
<p>
  To use these forces in a Newtonian system, we define energies that penalize deviation from the constraints, then differentiate those energies to produce forces.  In particular, if we have a constraint \(C(\vx)\), we define an energy \[E(\vx) = \frac{1}{2}k C(\vx)^2,\] where $k$ is a stiffness coefficient for this particular constraint, then define the force as \[\vf(\vx) = -\nabla E(\vx).\]  Since each constraint only depends on a few particles' positions, this notation expands to separate equations for the force on each particle participating in the constraint: \[\vf_i(\vp_1, \ldots, \vp_n) = -\nabla_{\vp_i} E(\vp_1, \ldots, \vp_n).\]
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, to use these forces in a position based dynamics system, we treat gravity and any other external forces in the conventional way, but after each time step we approximately solve the constraints by running a few steps of an iterative nonlinear system solver.  There are many approaches, but in this assignment we'll use the simple one proposed in the M&uuml;ller paper referenced above: consider constraints one at a time, for each one moving the system to the nearest state that solves a first-order approximation to that constraint.  In particular, if we have a constraint \(C(\vx) = 0\), we approximate the constraint by a first-order Taylor expansion:
  \[
  C(\vx + \Delta\vx) \approx C_1(\Delta\vx) = C(\vx_0) + \nabla C(\vx_0) \Delta\vx.
  \]
  The minimum solution to \(C_1(\Delta\vx) = 0\) is a multiple of the gradient \(\nabla C\):
  \[
  \Delta\vx = -\frac{C(\vx_0)}{\|\nabla C(\vx_0)\|^2}\nabla C(\vx_0).
  \]
  Since each constraint only depends on a few particles' positions, this notation expands to a separate projection rule for each particle participating in the constraint:
  \[
  \Delta\vp_i = -\frac{C(\vp_1, \ldots, \vp_n)}{\sum_j\|\nabla_{\vp_j} C(\vp_1, \ldots, \vp_n)\|^2}\nabla C(\vp_1, \ldots, \vp_n)
  \]
  where the \(\vp\)s in this case denote the current positions of the particles.

<h2>Written Part</h2>
<p>
  For the written part, we ask you to derive the formulas needed to implement the two methods for pin, stretching, and bending forces.  For each of these three forces, start from the constraint equations above and derive the equations required for implementation:
  <ol>
    <li>For each force write down the corresponding energy, and derive an expression for the force on each particle as a function of the position(s) of the particle(s) involved in the constraint.  Show how you obtained these equations, and verify they are equivalent to what is in the code for the Newtonian particle system.
    </li>
    <li>For each force compute the gradient of the constraint with respect to the particle position(s) and derive the constraint projection equations that you will use to implement position based dynamics in the programming part.  Show how you obtained these equations, and for the binary spring force verify they are equivalent to the equations given by M&uuml;ller et al.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <i>Hint</i>: For the stretching force and especially the bending force, it is convenient to use the chain rule to compose the derivatives from the derivatives of the simpler functions \(\ve(\vp_a, \vp_b) = \vp_b - \vp_a\) (the derivatives of this function are \(-I\) and \(I\) with respect to \(\vp_a\) and \(\vp_b\)) and \(n(\vv) = \vv / \|\vv\|\).
</p>

<h2>Programming Part</h2>

      <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

      <p>The code for this assignment is included in <a href="https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/cs5625/Spring19Framework">the class repository</a> as a new commit. As with previous assignments, you'll need to rerun CMake. This will create the <tt>Particles</tt> compilation targets. The framework programmatically builds one of several hard-coded scenes in the constructor of <tt>ParticlesApp</tt>, then integrates the system forward through time using one of three integrators.</p>

      <p>Like the earlier assignments, the framework is built on the NanoGUI framework and makes heavy use of the Eigen template library for matrices and vectors.</p>

      <h3>What is Already There</h3>

      <p>The framework ships with an already working implementation of a basic particle system with a Forward Euler integrator.  You'll find it has several small class hierarchies in the files <tt>ParticleSystem.hpp</tt>, <tt>ParticlesApp.hpp</tt>, <tt>ParticleRenderer.hpp</tt>, and their associated <tt>.cpp</tt> files.
      <ul>
        <li><tt>ParticleSystem.hpp</tt> contains the classes related to the particle system itself.
          <ul>
            <li><tt>ParticleSystem</tt>, which contains a collection of particles and a collection of forces that act on those particles, and provides simple methods to add and remove particles and forces and to pack/unpack the system state to/from Eigen vectors.</li>
            <li><tt>Particle</tt>, a simple structure with mass, position, and velocity, which also contains an accumulator for adding the different forces affecting this particle, and an index that is used for gathering particles into vectors.</li>
            <li><tt>Force</tt> and its subclasses, which represent particle interactions that can be treated as forces.  <tt>Force</tt> simply provides a virtual function to compute the force from the current system state and add the result to the force accumulators of the particles affected by the force.  Among the subclasses are the forces mentioned above, plus <tt>MouseForce</tt> which pulls a particle towards the ray defined by the mouse position, to allow simple user interaction with the simulation.</li>
            <li><tt>Constraint</tt> and its subclasses, which represent particle interactions that can be treated as constraints.   In the framework the only Constraints are also Forces, meaning they can be treated as forces by the Newtonian integrators and as constraints by the position-based integrator.  You'll note the three forces that you worked with in the written part appear as subclasses of <tt>Constraint</tt>.  In the starter code, <tt>Constraint</tt> is only a marker for constraints, but you will want to add one or more virtual functions here, similar to the way <tt>Force</tt> works.</li>
            <li><tt>Integrator</tt> and its subclasses, which represent different methods for evolving the particle system through time.  The framework contains the classes <tt>SympEulerIntegrator</tt> and <tt>PositionBasedIntegrator</tt> so that the UI code can refer to them, but their <tt>timestep</tt> methods are empty.
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ParticleRenderer.hpp</tt> contains classes concerning rendering, which you don't have to change but might like to in order to get nicer or more useful renderings.
          <ul>
            <li>An instance of <tt>Visual</tt> provides a visual representation of a collection of particles.  The two implemented are <tt>ParticleVisual</tt>, which draws particles as separated points, and <tt>RodVisual</tt>, which draws a list of particles as a chain of line segments.  Their implementations provide a simple example of the use of geometry shaders: the only thing these classes do is copy the particle positions to a buffer and draw it using <tt>GL_POINTS</tt> or <tt>GL_LINE_STRIP</tt>; the geometry shaders, found in <tt>resources/Particles/shaders/</tt>, expand these primitives into camera-facing quads.
            <li><tt>ParticleRenderer</tt> just holds a collection of <tt>Visual</tt>s and a method to render them all.
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><tt>ParticlesApp.hpp</tt> contains the main class for the app, which inherits from <tt>nanogui::Screen</tt> where most of the app's machinery comes from.  Most of the code here concerns UI and event handling, but there are some class members that are useful to understanding the particle system.
          <ul>
            <li><tt>camera</tt> and <tt>cameraController</tt> are responsible for the view of the 3D scene.</li>
            <li><tt>system</tt> and <tt>*Integrator</tt> instantiate objects from <tt>ParticleSystem</tt>, and <tt>context</tt> is used to communicate view and event information to the mouse force.</li>
            <li><tt>renderer</tt> instantiates <tt>ParticleRenderer</tt> for drawing the system state in the window.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul> 

      <h3>What to Add</h3>

      <p>Your mission is to make the integrators <tt>SympEulerIntegrator</tt> and <tt>PositionBasedIntegrator</tt> function.  This translates roughly to the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Implement <tt>SympEulerIntegrator</tt> following the example of <tt>FwdEulerIntegrator</tt>.  This is pretty simple to do, since these two integrators have extremely similar implementations.  You should find, however, that the symplectic integrator is vastly better behaved.</li>
          <li>Add to the interface of <tt>Constraint</tt>, following the example of <tt>Force</tt>, to provide the functionality needed by the position based integrator.  Implement this interface for all the <tt>Constraint</tt> subclasses.</li>
          <li>Implement <tt>PositionBasedIntegrator::timestep</tt>, following the M&uuml;ller paper.   This implementation starts off following the symplectic Euler method, but differs in two ways.  First, forces that are also <tt>Constraint</tt>s are skipped in the force accumulation phase.  Then, after the symplectic Euler step, the forces that are <tt>Constraint</tt>s apply the constraint projection step to the particles they affect.  You should loop over the constraints <tt>numIterations</tt> times, then compute new velocities from the original (pre-Euler-step) and final (post-constraint-projection) positions.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>When you have the position-based integrator working, you should find that it can provide very stiff behavior for cloth or rods with larger timesteps and less overall work per frame (i.e. higher FPS reading) than is possible with the symplectic Euler method.</p>

      <p><i>Hints</i>: You can use <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> to determine which forces can be treated as constraints in the position based integrator.  You can use the methods <tt>ParticleSystem.{get,set}{Positions,Velocities}</tt> to save the starting positions before you modify them in the Euler step, compute the velocities with an Eigen vector subtraction, and write the velocities back to the particles.

    
      <h3 id="what-to-submit">What to Submit</h3>

      <p>You should submit a ZIP file containing all the source codes and data in the <tt>Particles</tt> directory.  All the code you have written should be well commented and easy to read, and header comments for all modified files should appropriately indicate authorship.  Be sure to cite sources for any code or formulas that came from anywhere other than your head or this assignment document.  Also, put in the directory a README file explaining any implementation choices you made or difficulties you encountered.</p>
